## Philosophy

- opt for standard libraries over frameworks.
  - except for charm because it's awesome.
- create a mvp and iterate.


## filestructure

`cmd/` - main packages.
<!-- `content/` - content files. Will be embedded into the binary. -->
`content/public/` - unprotected static files. Will be served on `/static`.
