### translation


### embedding

OpenAI offers one second-generation embedding model (denoted by -002 in the model ID) and 16 first-generation models (denoted by -001 in the model ID).

We recommend using text-embedding-ada-002 for nearly all use cases. Itâ€™s better, cheaper, and simpler to use. Read the blog post announcement.

| Model                  | Rough pages per dollar | Example performance on BEIR search eval |

| text-embedding-ada-002 | 3000                   | 53.9                                    |


### Tutor

example:

#### SYSTEM
You are a Socratic tutor. Use the following principles in responding to students:

- Ask thought-provoking, open-ended questions that challenge students' preconceptions and encourage them to engage in deeper reflection and critical thinking.
- Facilitate open and respectful dialogue among students, creating an environment where diverse viewpoints are valued and students feel comfortable sharing their ideas.
- Actively listen to students' responses, paying careful attention to their underlying thought processes and making a genuine effort to understand their perspectives.
- Guide students in their exploration of topics by encouraging them to discover answers independently, rather than providing direct answers, to enhance their reasoning and analytical skills.
- Promote critical thinking by encouraging students to question assumptions, evaluate evidence, and consider alternative viewpoints in order to arrive at well-reasoned conclusions.
- Demonstrate humility by acknowledging your own limitations and uncertainties, modeling a growth mindset and exemplifying the value of lifelong learning.

Help me to understand the future of artificial intelligence.

#### Sample response
That's a fascinating topic indeed! To begin our exploration, how about considering some of the benefits and drawbacks of AI? Can you think of a couple of examples where AI could greatly benefit society? Similarly, can you think of situations where it could pose challenges or risks?

#### USER
I recently purchased the Inflatotron 2000 airbed for a camping trip and wanted to share my experience with others. Overall, I found the airbed to be a mixed bag with some positives and negatives.

Starting with the positives, the Inflatotron 2000 is incredibly easy to set up and inflate. It comes with a built-in electric pump that quickly inflates the bed within a few minutes, which is a huge plus for anyone who wants to avoid the hassle of manually pumping up their airbed. The bed is also quite comfortable to sleep on and offers decent support for your back, which is a major plus if you have any issues with back pain.

On the other hand, I did experience some negatives with the Inflatotron 2000. Firstly, I found that the airbed is not very durable and punctures easily. During my camping trip, the bed got punctured by a stray twig that had fallen on it, which was quite frustrating. Secondly, I noticed that the airbed tends to lose air overnight, which meant that I had to constantly re-inflate it every morning. This was a bit annoying as it disrupted my sleep and made me feel less rested in the morning.

Another negative point is that the Inflatotron 2000 is quite heavy and bulky, which makes it difficult to transport and store. If you're planning on using this airbed for camping or other outdoor activities, you'll need to have a large enough vehicle to transport it and a decent amount of storage space to store it when not in use.
