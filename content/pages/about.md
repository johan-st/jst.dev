# Full stack developer
*What can we learn today?*

## In the beginning

My career as a developer started in ernest in December 2020 when I graduated from School of applied technology [`</salt>`](https://salt.dev/) with 30 fellow students. We were selected among 1500 candidates for a three months accelerated career program to become a Full-Stack JavaScript developer. I was engaged as a consultant after my first interview and has since worked full time as a fullstack web developer.

## Now

My maxim is "strive for continious and sustainable improvement". I am a problem solver by nature and work hard to find pragmatic solutions within the given constraints.

On this page you will find my "tech-stack", some of my projects and the specific stack for each project. This portfolio for instance.
