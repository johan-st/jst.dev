# A Retrospective Glance: My First Few Years as A Full Stack Developer

Every field has its own journeys, lessons, and challenges. The technology field isn't any different. As a Full Stack Developer, I’ve experienced the adrenaline rush of solving complex coding problems, the joy that comes with flawless app deployment, and the occasional fiery sword battle with bugs. But let's rewind a bit, this story can't be told without starting from the very beginning.

## From Novice to Nerd: The Bootcamp 

I still remember my first day at the bootcamp. Just like most first-day experiences, it was full of excitement, anxiety, hundreds of questions, and an unquenchable thirst to learn. The order of the day? Dive heads-first from the shallow end (HTML and CSS) deeper into JavaScript, Node.js, React, Python, etc. Ah, the speed at which we had to learn these new languages and libraries, I miss that high-paced tempo.

The bootcamp was a rollercoaster ride, long hyper-active nights, riveted and spent in the company of fellow coding enthusiasts. The camaraderie was intoxicating; we helped each other out, driving ourselves onwards and upwards with a kind of energy, a synergy, a team spirit that was just electric. Every line of code we wrote, every function, every bug we cracked was a collective achievement.

## Welcome to the Jungle: The Early Years of Going Full Stack

My post bootcamp years were quite intense. The job demanded I put my newfound knowledge and skills to test, and I did. I learned on-the-go, made mistakes, fixed them, battled daunting tasks, and came out on the other side more enlightened. I learned that coding is not just about how good you are at writing it, but also about how well you can read and understand it, how well you can think and plan a solution. 

Working with my team, I was reminded of the bootcamp days. I found some of the spirit we'd had there right in the office. We shared laughs, failures, successes, and lots of pizzas. I worked with various people, each with their unique styles and methodology of coding. It was like living in a city with different dialects of coding. We understood each other, even in our differences.

## Looking Back, Looking Ahead

After these brilliant years, I can't help but miss being a bootcamp student. The process of learning something new every day, the high tempo, the team spirit, it casts a long, lingering shadow. Don't get me wrong, I love my field and everything I've achieved and experienced so far, but that phase had its charm. 

However, one doesn't simply stop learning, especially not in technology. It’s a never-ending learning curve with new languages, frameworks, libraries always popping up. The learning doesn't stop; it just takes on a different form. So, I am moving forward with innovation at my fingertips, ready to get to grips with what comes next. After all, once a coder, always a student.

And with that, I leave you with this: When the going gets tough, remember why you started. For me, it was the thrill of learning something new, the collaborative spirit, and the love of coding. It may be different for you, but never forget it. Hold on to it. It’s a part of your journey, a compass on this wild voyage of coding.
